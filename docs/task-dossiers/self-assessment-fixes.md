1. The guru responded this time, but the first thing it told me was that it couldn't actually see the board position and dice roll. I don't recall exactly how we were feeding this to the Backgammon guru in the project that we used as a model for this new self assessment functionality, but I've created another summary file derived from that other project that should help you bug and solve this issue (BUGFIX_SYNTHESIS_BOARD_VISIBILITY_AND_AUDIT_TRAILS.md)

2.  I really like the depth of reasoning and explanation it gave when justifying its answer, so I want to keep as much of that functionality as possible, but the context audit that it put at the bottom was delivered as part of the LLM response, which makes me think that it is explicitly NOT Following the patterns from that other project, where we are actually looking at the reasoning outputs from the Claude model, as well as being able to see the specific context, layers and knowledge files that were entered into the context window as part of the LLM "pre-reading" Before it attempted to answer the question. Again, reference that summary file (BUGFIX_SYNTHESIS_BOARD_VISIBILITY_AND_AUDIT_TRAILS.md) which should help you fix this and implement it in the way that it was implemented in the other project.

3. The Ground truth section is still failing to display any of the best moves and order any of the data that should be getting returned from the GNU backgammon Engine. That said, it's unclear to me whether the engine is working and we're just failing to properly parce It's outputs and display them on the front end, or whether we're failing to even successfully connect with and fetch data from that backgammon engine. This may be something that requires its own mini spec versus continuing to try and debug it in parallel to these other issues.
