Backgammon Game Phases and Strategic Adjustments
=================================================

PHASE OVERVIEW
--------------

Backgammon games typically progress through distinct phases, each requiring
different strategic approaches and priorities.

1. OPENING PHASE (First 4-6 moves)
   - Primary goal: Establish strong points
   - Key points: 5-point, bar-point (7-point), 4-point
   - Flexibility is paramount - don't commit too early
   - Build multiple options for different game types

2. EARLY MIDDLE GAME
   - Transition phase where game type becomes clearer
   - Continue point-making if possible
   - Watch for priming opportunities
   - Consider anchor establishment in opponent's home board

3. MIDDLE GAME
   - Game type is usually determined
   - Execute your chosen strategy
   - Attack timing becomes critical
   - Cube decisions become more frequent

4. BEAR-OFF PHASE
   - Efficiency is everything
   - Remove checkers whenever legal
   - Maintain balance in bear-off
   - Avoid wastage (using too many pips)

STYLE MODIFIERS (Player Approach)
---------------------------------

AGGRESSIVE STYLE:
- Prefers slotting early points
- Willing to accept blots for positional gains
- Plays for gammons more often
- Takes more cube risks

POSITIONAL STYLE:
- Prioritizes safety
- Builds points methodically
- Avoids unnecessary blots
- More conservative cube actions

BALANCED STYLE:
- Adapts to position requirements
- Neither overly aggressive nor passive
- Reads the game flow
- Maximizes expected value

PHASE-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS
--------------------------

In the Opening:
- Aggressive players slot more often
- Positional players prefer builders
- Both should make mandatory point-making rolls

In the Middle Game:
- Aggressive players attack weak positions immediately
- Positional players wait for better timing
- Both must recognize racing vs. priming games

In the Bear-Off:
- Both styles converge on efficiency
- Safety vs. speed trade-offs emerge
- Cube decisions become more calculated
