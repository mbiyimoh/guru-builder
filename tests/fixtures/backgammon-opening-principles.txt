Core Backgammon Opening Principles
===================================

These are the foundational concepts every backgammon player must understand.

CORE COMMANDMENTS (Always-On Heuristics)
----------------------------------------

1. Make strong points early - especially the 5-point, bar-point, and your opponent's 5-point.

2. Stay flexible - spread builders, avoid big stacks or buried checkers.

3. Reduce exposure when behind, press when ahead - volatility is a tool, not a goal.

4. Keep checkers connected - limit stranded men and long gaps between builders.

5. Bear off efficiently - remove checkers whenever legal while maintaining balance.

OPENING ROLL PRIORITY SYSTEM
----------------------------

Tier 1: Mandatory Point-Making (Must Make These Points)
- 3-1: Make 5-point (8/5, 6/5) - 100% of time
- 6-1: Make bar-point (13/7, 8/7) - 100% of time
- 4-2: Make 4-point (8/4, 6/4) - 99% of time

Tier 2: Strong Plays (Clear Best Moves)
- 5-3: Build (13/8, 13/10) - 75% / Run (24/16) - 25%
- 6-4: Run (24/14) - 60% / Split-build (24/18, 13/9) - 40%
- 5-4: Split-build (24/20, 13/8) or (13/8, 13/9)

Tier 3: Flexible Rolls (Style-Dependent)
- Smaller rolls (2-1, 3-2, 4-3, 5-2): Multiple reasonable approaches
- Choice depends on aggressive vs. positional style
- All options within 2-3% of each other

OPENING ROLL DECISION FRAMEWORK
-------------------------------

Ask yourself:
1. Can I make a key point (5, 4, or 7)? -> If yes, make it
2. Can I create good builders? -> If yes, do so
3. Should I split my back checkers? -> Depends on roll and style
4. Should I run with 6-5 or 6-4? -> Usually yes, unless specific position

THE GOLDEN 3-1 (Making the 5-Point)
-----------------------------------

Roll: 3-1
Play: 8/5, 6/5

Analysis:
- Makes the most valuable point on the board (5-point)
- This is the only opening roll with a mandatory play
- Creates immediate home board strength
- Anchor point for future offense and defense
- Computer analysis: 8/5, 6/5 is +12% better than alternatives

Key Lesson: When you can make the 5-point on the opening roll, always do it.
