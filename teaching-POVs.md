1. First and foremost, progressive disclosure. In today's world, if someone sees more than two or three lines of relatively small text, their brain automatically wants to disengage. So even if there is in theory a lot of things that we might want to explain to the person here, we need to be really ruthless about how we prioritize those things, and about how we structure the content so that we can give them just that 2 to 3 line summary initially while encouraging in somewhat enticing them to dig deeper/tap on some button that then reveals a few more bits of information that put the first brief explanation in further context
2. I have a strong point of view around taking a principle-driven approach to teaching. Right now, we are designing the overall experience to orient around the standard phases of the game. Within each phase, and even more broadly just within the game of backgammon, regardless of the phase, there are always a handful of key principles that, if you craft your whole strategy around, just optimizing those two or three things, is going to lead to good outcomes for you more often than that. So as we think about how to present the right answer to someone who just got the answer wrong, I want our content and explanation experience to be heavily rooted in principles, so that the next time the person sees the situation like this, instead of thinking about what the specific right play is, they think about the one or two principles that we emphasized, and then ask themselves, well what would be the play that maximizes for these one or two things that I was told are the most important things to think about in situations like these?

The Research Foundation
The research consistently points to several key principles that directly support your instincts:
On Progressive Disclosure (your point #1):
Cognitive Load Theory acknowledges the limitation of working memory when dealing with new information, in both capacity and duration. Learning and performance are optimized when instruction is designed according to human cognitive architecture. PubMed Central The research on microlearning specifically shows that segmenting information—dividing content into smaller, more digestible units—helps learners process information more effectively. Research suggests that microlearning techniques, where learners engage with short, focused lessons, can improve retention and understanding. IJRPR
On Principle-Based Learning (your point #2):
This is where schema theory becomes crucial. Research found that the more expertise a person has in a particular area, the easier they find it to categorize and then solve problems because they have greater, deeper conceptual knowledge and understanding of principles and ideas. Education Corner A key study with physics students showed that experts classified problems differently from novices. The experts, because of their conceptual grasp, had strategies for solutions that matched the problems already to hand. Education Corner
This is exactly what you're trying to build: transforming novice backgammon players (who see surface features like "I have a 5-2 and pieces on the 8-point") into principle-driven thinkers ("This is a Golden Anchor situation").
