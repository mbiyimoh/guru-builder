# MODULE 1: BASIC OPENING ROLLS

## DETAILED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: The Golden 3-1 (Making the 5-Point)

**Roll: 3-1**
**Play: 8/5, 6/5**

Analysis:
- Makes the most valuable point on the board (5-point)
- This is the only opening roll with a mandatory play
- Creates immediate home board strength
- Anchor point for future offense and defense
- Computer analysis: 8/5, 6/5 is +12% better than alternatives

Alternative plays are all significantly weaker:
- 24/21, 13/12 (splitting and building) is the next best at -12%
- Any other play is a serious error

Key Lesson: When you can make the 5-point on the opening roll, always do it.

### Example 2: The Powerful 6-1 (Making the Bar-Point)

**Roll: 6-1**
**Play: 13/7, 8/7**

Analysis:
- Makes the bar-point (7-point), the second most valuable opening point
- Controls the outfield
- Blocks opponent's 6's from escaping
- Creates strong defensive structure
- 99.9% of experts play this move

Why it's mandatory:
- Bar-point is worth approximately +8% equity
- Alternative moves (like 24/18, 13/7) are significantly weaker
- Making two key points early (6 and 7) gives excellent position

Key Lesson: The bar-point is so valuable that making it on opening trumps all other considerations.

### Example 3: The Builder Play 5-3

**Roll: 5-3**
**Play: 13/8, 13/10**

Analysis:
- Creates two builders in perfect position
- Threatens to make 4-point, 5-point, 7-point, or 9-point
- Flexible development without exposing blots
- Most common expert choice (75% play this)

Alternative: 24/16 (running)
- Also reasonable (25% of experts)
- More conservative
- Good against aggressive opponents

Key Lesson: Multiple builders in the outfield create maximum future flexibility.

## RISK CALCULATION GUIDE

### Opening Roll Priority System

**Tier 1: Mandatory Point-Making (Must Make These Points)**
- 3-1: Make 5-point (8/5, 6/5) - 100% of time
- 6-1: Make bar-point (13/7, 8/7) - 100% of time
- 4-2: Make 4-point (8/4, 6/4) - 99% of time

**Tier 2: Strong Plays (Clear Best Moves)**
- 5-3: Build (13/8, 13/10) - 75% / Run (24/16) - 25%
- 6-4: Run (24/14) - 60% / Split-build (24/18, 13/9) - 40%
- 5-4: Split-build (24/20, 13/8) or (13/8, 13/9)
- 6-3: Split-build (24/18, 13/10) or make point (24/18, 18/15)
- 6-2: Slot or run (multiple good options)

**Tier 3: Flexible Rolls (Style-Dependent)**
- Smaller rolls (2-1, 3-2, 4-3, 5-2): Multiple reasonable approaches
- Choice depends on aggressive vs. positional style
- All options within 2-3% of each other

### Opening Roll Decision Framework

**Ask yourself:**
1. Can I make a key point (5, 4, or 7)? → If yes, make it
2. Can I create good builders? → If yes, do so
3. Should I split my back checkers? → Depends on roll and style
4. Should I run with 6-5 or 6-4? → Usually yes, unless specific position

### Quick Reference: Opening Roll Table

| Roll | Play | Type | Priority |
|------|------|------|----------|
| 3-1 | 8/5, 6/5 | Make 5-pt | Mandatory |
| 6-1 | 13/7, 8/7 | Make bar | Mandatory |
| 4-2 | 8/4, 6/4 | Make 4-pt | Mandatory |
| 5-3 | 13/8, 13/10 | Builders | Strong |
| 6-4 | 24/14 | Run | Strong |
| 6-5 | 24/13 | Run | Strong |
| 2-1 | 24/23, 13/11 | Split-slot | Flexible |
| 4-3 | 24/21, 13/9 | Split-build | Flexible |

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake #1: Not Making Mandatory Points

**✗ Bad Example:**
Rolling 3-1 and playing 24/21, 13/12 instead of 8/5, 6/5

Why it's wrong:
- Gives up the most valuable opening opportunity
- 5-point is worth ~12% equity
- No other play comes close
- Beginners do this trying to be "flexible"

**✓ Correct:**
Always make the 5-point with 3-1, no exceptions

### Mistake #2: Splitting Too Often

**✗ Bad Example:**
Splitting back checkers on every small roll (2-1, 3-2, 4-1, etc.)

Why it's wrong:
- Creates too many vulnerable blots
- Gives opponent hitting opportunities
- Neglects home board development

**✓ Better:**
Split selectively, usually 1-2 times in first 5 rolls maximum

### Mistake #3: Running Without Plan

**✗ Bad Example:**
Running 24/13 with 6-5 without considering opponent's response

Why it's wrong:
- Runner becomes target on 13-point
- Opponent can attack with 6's and 8's
- Should only run if prepared for battle

**✓ Better:**
Run when you can follow up with builders or accept being hit

### Mistake #4: Making Weak Points Too Early

**✗ Bad Example:**
Opening 6-2, playing 24/18, 18/16 to make 16-point

Why it's wrong:
- 16-point has minimal value
- Uses two checkers inefficiently
- Better to slot valuable points or develop

**✓ Better:**
Make valuable points (5,4,7,20,21) or develop flexibly

### Mistake #5: Playing Too Slowly

**✗ Bad Example:**
Always playing the safest, most passive option

Why it's wrong:
- Falls behind in development
- Allows opponent to build freely
- Opening is time for controlled aggression

**✓ Better:**
Accept reasonable risks for development in opening

## ADVANCED CONCEPTS

### Concept 1: Opening Roll Sequences

**The Ideal Opening Sequence:**
1st roll: Make point (3-1, 6-1, 4-2) or develop (5-3, 6-4)
2nd roll: Make another point or create builders
3rd roll: Continue development

**Example Perfect Start:**
- You: 3-1 (make 5-point)
- Opp: 4-3 (split-build)
- You: 6-1 (make bar-point)
- You now have 5,6,7 points → excellent position

**The Danger Sequence:**
- You: Small awkward rolls (2-1, 3-2)
- Opp: Makes point (3-1 or 6-1)
- You: Another weak roll
- You're now behind in development race

**Advanced Principle:** Opening roll luck matters significantly. First 3-4 rolls often determine game trajectory.

### Concept 2: Opponent Response Planning

**When You Roll First:**
Always consider opponent's likely responses:

**You roll 3-1 (make 5-point):**
- Opponent will likely hit or split if they roll 2's or 1's
- Opponent will develop with larger rolls
- You should prepare to either defend or attack next turn

**You roll 6-5 (run to 13-point):**
- Opponent has many hitting opportunities
- 6's and 8's hit your blot
- Plan to either cover, make anchor, or accept hit

**Advanced Principle:** Your opening play should anticipate opponent's most dangerous responses.

### Concept 3: The Opening Duel

**Point-Making Race:**
Opening is often a race to make key points first:
- Both players want 5-point, 4-point, bar-point
- Whoever makes 2-3 of these first gains advantage
- Tempo matters greatly

**The Counter-Attack Opening:**
If opponent makes strong point, you should:
- Make your own strong point if possible
- Attack their blots aggressively
- Create complications if behind

**Advanced Principle:** Opening is competitive point-making. Don't let opponent develop unopposed.

### Concept 4: Style-Based Opening Choices

**Aggressive Opening Style:**
- Slot more often (6-2: 24/18, 13/11)
- Split frequently
- Accept volatility for tempo

**Positional Opening Style:**
- Make points naturally
- Build solid structure
- Avoid unnecessary blots

**Running Opening Style:**
- Run with 6-5, 6-4 always
- Escape back checkers early
- Simplify to racing positions

**Advanced Principle:** Your opening style should match your overall backgammon philosophy and strengths.

### Concept 5: The Mathematics of Opening Rolls

**Roll Probability:**
- You have 15 distinct opening rolls
- Opponent has 15 distinct opening rolls
- Total combinations: 15 × 15 = 225 unique opening positions

**Key Roll Probabilities:**
- 3-1: 2/36 = 5.56%
- 6-1: 2/36 = 5.56%
- 4-2: 2/36 = 5.56%
- Any specific non-double: 2/36
- Any double: 1/36

**Position After 1 Roll:**
- 15 possible positions for you
- Each position has different equity
- Best: Made 5-point (+6% equity)
- Worst: Bad builder placement (-2% equity)
- Range: 8% equity spread based purely on opening luck

**Advanced Principle:** Opening roll luck creates initial equity swings of 5-8%, which skilled play can amplify or minimize.

### Concept 6: Modern vs. Traditional Opening Theory

**Traditional Opening Theory (1970s-1990s):**
- Very formulaic
- Strict adherence to "correct" moves
- Less splitting, more safe development

**Modern Opening Theory (2000s-present):**
- More flexible
- Computer-validated variations
- More aggressive splitting and slotting
- Multiple "correct" approaches for many rolls

**Key Differences:**
- 2-1: Traditional = 13/11, 6/5; Modern = 24/23, 13/11 (often)
- 4-3: Traditional = 13/10, 13/9; Modern = 24/21, 13/9 (often)
- 6-2: Traditional = 24/16; Modern = 24/18, 13/11 (sometimes)

**Advanced Principle:** Modern theory validates more aggressive approaches that older books condemned.

### Concept 7: The "Non-Contact" Opening Philosophy

**Concept:**
Some positions benefit from avoiding early contact:
- When ahead in match score
- When opponent is stronger tactically
- When position favors racing

**Implementation:**
- Run with 6-5, 6-4 more often
- Avoid splitting
- Focus on building, not attacking

**Counter-Strategy:**
If opponent plays non-contact:
- Attack aggressively
- Make advanced anchors
- Create complications

**Advanced Principle:** Opening strategy should consider match situation and relative skill levels, not just position.
