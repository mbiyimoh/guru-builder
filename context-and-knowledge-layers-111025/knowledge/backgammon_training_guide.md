## **OPENING PHASE MODULES**

### **Module 1: Basic Opening Rolls**

**Position Examples:**
- **Opening 3-1**: Correct play is 8/5, 6/5 (making the 5-point)
- **Opening 6-1**: Correct play is 13/7, 8/7 (making the 7-point)  
- **Opening 4-2**: Correct play is 8/4, 6/4 (making the 4-point)
- **Opening 6-5**: Correct play is 24/13 (running one back checker)

**Exercises:**
1. Memorize the top 3 plays for each opening roll from 1-1 through 6-6
2. Practice quick recognition: Given an opening roll, name the best play within 3 seconds
3. Explain why 3-1: 8/5, 6/5 is better than 3-1: 24/21, 13/12

**Practice Problems:**
- You open with 2-1. What's the best play and why?
- Opponent opens 4-3 playing 24/21, 13/9. You roll 6-1. What do you play?
- You open 5-3. Compare 13/8, 13/10 vs 13/10, 24/21. Which is better?

### **Module 2: Slotting Strategy**

**Position Examples:**
- **Opening 6-2**: Aggressive slot: 24/18, 13/11 vs Safe play: 24/16
- **Opening 2-1**: Bold slot: 13/11, 6/5 vs Conservative: 24/23, 13/11
- **Responding to 6-1 (13/7, 8/7)**: Rolling 5-2, do you play 24/17 or 13/8, 13/11?

**Exercises:**
1. Identify 5 opening rolls where slotting is the top choice
2. Calculate: If you slot the 11-point, what are opponent's chances of hitting next turn?
3. Compare risk/reward of different slotting options for the same roll

**Practice Problems:**
- You roll 5-4 to open. Compare 13/8, 13/9 vs 24/15. When would you choose each?
- After opponent's 3-1 (8/5, 6/5), you roll 4-1. Analyze 24/20, 13/12 vs other plays
- Opening 1-1: Is 8/7(2), 6/5(2) too bold? Compare with safer alternatives

---

### **Module 3: Splitting and Running**

**Position Examples:**
- **Opening 4-3**: Run with 24/17 vs Split with 24/21, 13/9 vs Build with 13/9, 13/10
- **Opening 6-4**: 24/14 vs 24/18, 13/9 vs 8/2, 6/2

**Exercises:**
1. Calculate how often your split checker gets attacked from the bar-point
2. Practice identifying when early running is correct vs. risky
3. Learn follow-up plays after successful splits

**Practice Problems:**

### **Module 4: Point-Making Priorities**

**Position Examples:**
- **5-point vs 4-point**: When you can make either, why choose 5-point?
- **7-point timing**: Positions where making bar-point is more urgent than 5-point  
- **Lower points**: When making 3-point or 2-point becomes necessary

**Exercises:**
1. Rank all 24 points by general value in opening/early middle game
2. Identify positions where normal point-making priority changes
3. Practice recognizing "point-making races" between opponents

---

### **Module 19: Irregular Distributions**

**Position Examples:**
