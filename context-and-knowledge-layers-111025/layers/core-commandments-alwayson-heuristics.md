These are universal truths of strong backgammon play.
They should always anchor the model’s reasoning and explanations.

Core ideas:
	1.	Make strong points early – especially the 5-point, bar-point, and your opponent’s 5-point.
	2.	Stay flexible – spread builders, avoid big stacks or buried checkers.
	3.	Reduce exposure when behind, press when ahead – volatility is a tool, not a goal.
	4.	Keep checkers connected – limit stranded men and long gaps between builders.
	5.	Bear off efficiently – remove checkers whenever legal while maintaining balance.

How the LLM uses this layer:
	•	Always start from these principles when evaluating or explaining a move.
	•	When comparing two close moves, it should default to whichever better satisfies more commandments.
	•	Feedback should reference these as “fundamentals” (e.g., “This play better follows the principle of building new points instead of overstacking”).
