The “phase” gives the LLM context for which commandments matter most right now.
It shifts how general principles are prioritized.

### Phase Modifiers

| **Phase** | **Typical Board Characteristics** | **Primary Goals** | **Common Pitfalls** |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Opening** | Few points made, stacks on 6/13, back checkers on 24 | Develop builders, make key points (especially 5-point and bar-point), split back checkers early | Playing too safe and missing opportunities to build structure early |
| **Middle** | Points and anchors established, contact ongoing, primes forming | Commit to a plan (blitz, prime, race, holding), manage volatility, maintain timing | Breaking structure too early or ignoring tempo opportunities |
| **End** | One or both players bearing off, limited or no contact | Bear off efficiently, avoid gaps, minimize wastage, manage shots under contact | Overexposure when opponent still has contact; inefficient checker distribution |

How the LLM uses this layer:
	•	Identify phase (opening, middle, end) from board features.
	•	Adjust weighting of commandments accordingly:
	•	Opening → prioritize building & flexibility.
	•	Middle → prioritize plan coherence & tempo.
	•	End → prioritize efficiency & safety.
	•	Feedback phrasing should show awareness of phase (e.g., “At this stage of the game, flexibility matters more than safety…”).
