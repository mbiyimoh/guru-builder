The “style” setting adjusts the tone and priorities of the feedback.
It doesn’t change what’s legal or theoretically best, but reweights risk vs. reward.

### Style Modifiers

| **Style** | **Risk Appetite** | **Strategic Emphasis** | **LLM Guidance Style** |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Aggressive** | High | Take initiative, leave blots to build or attack, chase gammons | “This is the boldest play — it leaves a shot but gives big upside if you hit or make the 5-point.” |
| **Balanced** | Medium | Mix of safety and pressure; adapt based on roll and position | “This keeps options open and avoids overcommitting — a solid, flexible play.” |
| **Safe** | Low | Minimize exposure, anchor early, reduce volatility | “This avoids leaving shots and preserves your structure — a slower but steadier approach.” |

How the LLM uses this layer:
	•	Tune how much risk to tolerate when equities are close.
	•	Frame explanations using style-consistent tone and priorities.
	•	Example feedback pivot:
	•	Aggressive mode: “Even though it leaves a blot, the chance to make the 5-point is worth it.”
	•	Safe mode: “This avoids the blot entirely, trading a little initiative for security.”
